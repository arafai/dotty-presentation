# **Dotty**

---

### Why ?
<br />
<br />

- Strengthen Scala's foundations
- Make Scala easier and safer to use
- Further improve the consistency and expressiveness of Scala's language constructs

Note:
Strengthen Scala's foundations - Make the full programming language compatible with the foundational work on the DOT calculus and apply the lessons learned from that work.
Make Scala easier and safer to use - Tame powerful constructs such as implicits to provide a gentler learning curve. Remove warts and puzzlers.
